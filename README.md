This is a bulk name checker for Minecraft. You can enter a list of names and check whether they are available.
Main features include reading in .txt files and using a minimal number of requests so you can check more names before you are timed out.

Using the Mojang bulk api 10 names can be check with one request.
Mojang allows 600 requests every 10 minutes so with this program you can check 6000 names every 10 minutes.
